# Data Scientist


Kickfurther is creating a marketplace that serves users who want to earn money by participating in the retail economy, and consumer product businesses who need financing for inventory to meet their own growing demand and production cycles. We use 3rd-party data integrations from a wide variety of sources to vet co-op applications and automate business processes. We regularly close crowd-sourced funding campaigns in just a few minutes as our user base rushes to fund co-ops, meaning that we simultaneously process many transactions in a seamless way.

Kickfurther just closed its largest investment round; there is a lot to accomplish and we have the means to accomplish it. Do you want to join our funded, growing team to help build our differentiated approach focused on crowd-funding physical inventory?

The team is still fairly small, so all your contributions will be noticed. All of your work will be deployed once it is reviewed; you’ll be a key part of building our data platform.

## What we value
Along with honesty and a strong work ethic, we value the ability to learn and grow, both as individuals and as members of a team. We embrace modern technology, but we also recognize the value of the tried and true so that we can create a robust, stable fintech platform. We stick to lightweight processes and tools, but we place a higher value on the people and the team. We try to create an environment where people are happy, because happy people make better decisions, write better code, and make great products. We prefer simple solutions to complex problems, and complicate things only when absolutely necessary.
