Mid to Senior Level Laravel Full-stack Engineer
===============================================

Kickfurther is creating a marketplace that serves users who want to
earn money by participating in the retail economy, and consumer product
businesses who need financing for inventory to meet their own growing
demand and production cycles. We use 3rd-party data integrations from a
wide variety of sources to vet co-op applications and automate business
processes. We regularly close crowd-sourced funding campaigns in just a
few minutes as our user base rushes to fund co-ops, meaning that we
simultaneously process many transactions in a seamless way.

Kickfurther itself just closed our largest investment round; there is a
lot to accomplish and we have the means to accomplish it. Do you want to
join oud funded, growing team to help build our differentiated approach
focused on crowd-funding physical inventory?

We are looking for a few full-stack engineers for our dev team. The
team is still fairly small, so all your contributions will be noticed.
All of your work will be deployed once it is reviewed, so you will be
an essential part of building our platform.
